# STM32 Practice Codes

Each c file in this project does a seperated work using the STM32 micro-controller. In order to run these files you are going to need STM32CubeMx software to set GPIO pins of the micro-controller.

## File Descriptions
**blinking_led.c:** The code to blink a simple led.

**moving_helloworld.c:** This codes prints "Hello World" on a character lcd and each time shift it 1 character to right.

**write_on_lcd.c:** Prints each keypad button pressed on the lcd.

**locker.c:** The code for simulating a 3 character pass code locker.

**interrupt.c:** Uses the interrupt feature of micro-controller to stop the process running for a short time.
